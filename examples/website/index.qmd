I created this website to document my learning process using Quarto. I hope it can help you too!

Please note that the website is still **under construction**, so you might encounter some issues. If you do, feel free to let me know by sending me an [email](mailto:angelofgdsantos@gmail.com)

Quarto is an amazing publishing tool to create websites, presentations, documents and other cool stuff. 

These are the sections I have for now:

- [About](about.qmd)
- [Websites](websites.qmd)
- <u>Examples</u> shows some pages, or websites I created using Quarto
