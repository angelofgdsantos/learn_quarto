Websites are powerful tools to show your work to the world! Not only that, can be a great way to document and organize your projects in a visual way - exaclty what I am trying to do right now üò¨

This Page will have multiple sections on how to customize your website, from the basic to the fancy stuff. I hope to include enough content to create a nice website for yourself ü§ôüèΩ let's do it!

::: {.callout-warning icon="üëÄ"}

Remember that Quarto has a great [website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) with **A LOT** of information on websites.

# Website setup

First things first, we need to learn how to setup the basic structure of our website. This include first order things like [themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html), titles, format, navigation bar and others.

To start, create a website Quarto Project to generate the base files. I am using VS Code and this is what I need to do: 

![](/gifs/create_website_vs.png)

After creating a project folder, you can fin a file called _quarto.yaml. This is the key file to setup your website settings. For example, this is the _quarto.yaml for this website:

``` yaml
---
project:
  type: website                   # <1>
  output-dir: ../../docs          # <2>

website:
  title: "Learning Quarto"        # <3>
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd           # <4>
        text: Home                
      - href: websites.qmd
        text: Websites
      - href: dashboard.qmd
        text: Dashboards
      - text: Examples
        menu: 
        - href: authoring.qmd
          text: Example 1
        - href: computational.qmd
          text: Example 2
        - href: walkthrough.qmd
          text: Example 3         # <4>


format:     
  html:
    theme: sketchy            # <5>
    toc: true                 # <6>

## Customization

A nice thing about a personal website is to own it and make it reflect your style! Take care, this can bring you to a noendless rabbit hole, and sometime it is hard to get out ü´†

I will go over some customizations that I learned while creating my content. 

### Themes
### Style

  1. Fonts
  2. Colors

### Logo and Favicons

  I really like logos and favicons. For some reason I believe they can tell something about you, your story or just make the website visually satisfying. 
  
  In my case, I choosed a tree for my personal website favicon and logo, why ü§î  I love nature and hiking, trees are gorgeous and so diverse! They are impressive separatelly and together as a biosystem. Also, I am an enviromental economist working with deforestation, nothing more clear than a tree for my logo.

  But what really matters is...

  ``` yaml

website:
  title: "Angelo Santos"
  favicon: /images/favicon.ico      # <1>
  navbar:
    logo: /images/favicon-32x32.png  # <2>
    left:
  
  ```
  1. Define your favicon
  2. Define a logo that show up with the website title

I encourage you to look for favicon online, maybe AI can also help with creating an original and nice favicon. Tell us someone about you or you document through this!
