Websites are powerful tools to show your work to the world! Not only that, can be a great way to document and organize your projects in a visual way - exaclty what I am trying to do right now üò¨

After creating a project folder, you can fin a file called _quarto.yaml. This is the key file to setup your website settings. For example, if you want to edit the website title you can find some like the following
